## Description

### What is this task?

Describe the goal of the task. What will hunters be doing? Give them a taste of what victory will entail. What are they signing up for? What is the objective? This should be detailed. Maybe include pictures, links, a video? Help your hunters out, give them what they need to succeed.

Keep in mind too the bounty reviewers. They can only judge based off what the bounty criteria entails. 

Be explicit, be clear, make it fun, but stay on point.

### What are the requirements for the bounty hunter?

Who is this bounty intended for? What kind of skills will be required of them? Do they need to know Typescript? Is this more of a docs writing assignment? What skills, abilities and affinities will this bounty best suit?

### What are the deliverables?

This is the most critically important piece of the proposal, what â€“ in bullet point detail â€“ is being built. What will exist at the end of this hunt which did not exist at the beginning?

This section consists of three primary points.

#### Bounty Description
  - What are the material assets being delivered?
  - A PR? A marketing graphic? A live functional website?
  - Be succinct but painfully specific

#### Review Criteria
  - How will reviewers interact with and consider this bounty?
  - Will it be the quality of the code? It's consistency with an existing codebase? Are detailed comments and descriptions of high value?
  - What would make this an insufficient submission for review if it were missing?
  
#### Submission Procedure
  - Are there any unique steps for the bounty hunter to be aware of before submitting this bounty for review?
  - Any additional PRs they need to submit?
  - Any issues they need to be aware of?
  - Any third parties they need to communicate with?
