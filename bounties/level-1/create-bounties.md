## Description

### What is this task?

The quintessence of Stellar Quest Bounties are - *drumroll* - the bounties!  
To be able to provide interesting but also useful projects every idea is desirable.  
To do justice to the idea of Stellar Quest Bounties, what else than to host a bounty hunt to create new bounties! _Bounty-ception!_  

### What are the requirements for the bounty hunter?
This task involves suggesting useful bounties to the Stellar Quest Bounty repository.  
_Suggested bounties must be related to the Stellar ecosystem._

Following standards are to be incorporated:
 
* The [given template file](https://github.com/tyvdh/stellar-quest-bounties/blob/main/bounties/README.md) must be used as a baseline for all submissions.

* The level and payout should be determined by difficulty / effort of the task given.  

* Typical payouts and difficulty assessments for each level can be found in the related `level-{n}/README.md`
  - [Level 1](https://github.com/tyvdh/stellar-quest-bounties/blob/main/bounties/level-1/README.md)
  - [Level 2](https://github.com/tyvdh/stellar-quest-bounties/blob/main/bounties/level-2/README.md)
  - [Level 3](https://github.com/tyvdh/stellar-quest-bounties/blob/main/bounties/level-3/README.md)

* The submitted Markdown file must be placed in the folder of the given difficulty and named after the bounty title. Example given: `level-{n}/my-bounty-name.md`.

Overall there is a lot of freedom regarding possible quests therefore: be creative!
