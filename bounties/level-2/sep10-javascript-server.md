## Description

### What is this task?

The Stellar ecosystem is comprised of many different developers, validators,
organizations, individuals, etc. that work together to make the network run in a
smooth, predictable, and reliable manner. To that end, there are many
**S**tellar **E**cosystem **P**roposals (**SEP**s) that serve to instruct the
network about how certain actions should (or should not) be done.

The **[SEP-0010 specification](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0010.md)**
is one such SEP which dictates how Stellar web authentication is to be done. The
SEP includes instructions on how servers should be developed, what they are
expected to send/receive, as well as how clients should interact with those
servers to authenticate to the network for purposes of establishing a session
for the user.

In order for developers to make use of these SEPs, many of them contain
"Reference Implementations," indicating what a *vanilla* example of the SEP
functioning in the real world might look like.

Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to build, document, and make
publicly available a fully-functional server-side application, written in
JavaScript, that fills the role of the server in the SEP-0010 authentication
flow.

When deployed, this implementation should successfully produce a **J**SON
**W**eb **T**oken (**JWT**) after authenticating with a client. All SEP-0010
endpoints should be working and producing the appropriate responses (both
success and error).

### What are the requirements for the bounty hunter?

The bounty hunter should be familiar with JavaScript, HTTP request methods, and
testing. They ought to be able to create a server-side application that receives
and responds to various API calls and endpoints.

### What are the deliverables?

#### Submission Procedure

  - The bounty hunter will submit a link to a GitHub repository containing the
    reference implementation, coded in either vanilla JavaScript or TypeScript.
  - The bounty hunter will submit a link to the SEP-0010 implementation hosted
    online (**must** be accessible through HTTPS).
  - The hosted instance of the reference implementation will closely adhere to
    the **[SEP-0010 specification](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0010.md)**
    as described in the `stellar/stellar-protocol` repository.
  - The reference implementation will incorporate any necessary unit tests
    throughout the codebase.

#### Review Criteria

  - Reviewers will attempt to authenticate with the Stellar network, using the
    submitted server implementation.
  - Reviewers will examine each of the API endpoints for accurate responses.
  - Reviewers will inspect the JWT to ensure all relevant pieces are included.
  - Reviewers will pay special attention to testing the various conditional and
    optional pieces of the authentication flow.
