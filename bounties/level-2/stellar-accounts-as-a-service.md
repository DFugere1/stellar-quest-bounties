## Description

### What is this task?

Each Stellar account needs to hold 1 XLM to be valid. This can be costly when companies like exchanges want to build
on the Stellar network.

Currently, exchanges assign each of their users a unique id that should be put in the memo field of a transaction when depositing.
This approach is error-prone. Users can forget to add the memo, or they can input the wrong memo.

To solve this issue [muxed accounts](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0027.md) were added to Stellar. Muxed accounts are essentially a way to combine Stellar addresses with integer identifiers.
Payments sent to a muxed account are actually sent to the account used to create the muxed account. However, the muxed account identifier is also added to the transaction.

For this bounty the task is to create an API for a [custodial](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/crypto-wallets-custodial-vs-noncustodial) wallet service using muxed accounts.
A simple database should be used to keep track of the registered users, their muxed account addresses and their balances.

The api should have the following endpoints:

### What are the requirements for the bounty hunter?
The hunter should be able to make simple Web APIs.

### What are the deliverables?

#### Bounty Description
- The hunter should provide a link to the repository containing the solution.
- The API should be hosted online or posted to a website like [repl.it](https://replit.com/~) to make it easier for reviewers to review the solution.
- The API **must** be served over https
- The API **must not** use the _PUBLIC_ network


#### Review Criteria
- The API should be tested to insure proper functionality.
- Code quality is not of primary importance but should be reasonable reviewable.
- Security is also not primarily important but at least some attention should have been paid to security. Basic things like hashing passwords and mitigating SQL injections should have been done.
