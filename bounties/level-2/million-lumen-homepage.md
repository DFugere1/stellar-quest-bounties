## Description

### What is this task?

Remember the Million Dollar Homepage? It was an interesting concept, and it's high time we implement it on Stellar!
The task is to create a grid of million pixels up for sale and the cost of each individual pixel is 1 XLM.

### What are the requirements for the bounty hunter?

The developer should have knowledge of Web Technologies and Stellar SDK.

### What are the deliverables?

*Description* <br>
  * The developer should provide a link to a repository implementing the new functionality.

*Judging Criteria and Metrics* <br>
  * MVP - Does the functionality match with what's stated in the [proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Million_Dollar_Homepage)? And how similar it is to the original concept?
  * UX - Is the UI intuitive and user friendly? Does it adhere to design standards for UI elements and interactions?
  
*Submission Procedure* <br>
  * Submit a link to your repository as a PR on the bounty document itself.

## Ideas
 * Maybe consider using IPFS or Arweave to store and reference the data with an immutable link from the Stellar blockchain to our NFT. If you are trying to use some other storage, make sure to atleast have a unique content identifier for the stored data so we know nobody can replace or alter the content without breaking the link.
 * Maybe you could build the page out of memo identifies of payments.
 * If you're planning to mint and store the NFT on the Stellar blockchain itself, make sure to factor in the number of data entries allowed on a Stellar account.
