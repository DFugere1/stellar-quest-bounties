## Description

### What is this task?

Some developers love reading tutorials, some prefer watching videos to easily follow what to expect. Your task is to help increase recognition of Stellar ecosystem by producing a video walkthrough with (but not limited to) below topics:

 - Explain like I'm Five: everything about Stellar ecosystem
 - Established ecosystem project walkthroughs. Apps like StellarX, DSTOQ, SatoshiPay, Coinqvest, etc.
 - Implementation of Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (aka SEPs) in multiple coding languages
 - Simple functional projects to demonstrate Stellar available operations


### What are the requirements for the bounty hunter?

 - The bounty hunter should have good knowledge of Stellar and can create productive walkthrough videos. They should be familiar with Stellar supported SDKs.
 - `(Optional)` The bounty hunter can boost their reward if they have a well-established viewer base such as:
   - A YouTube, Vimeo, etc. channel with more than 1,000 subscribers
   - A tutorial blog with more than 10,000 pageviews per month

### What are the deliverables?
- The video itself, uploaded to Youtube, Vimeo, or any popular video hosting sites
- A link to the codebase for coding walkthroughs - preferably a branch or dedicated repo

#### Bounty Description
  - The hunter should create a minimum 2-min video

#### Review Criteria
  - The quality of content in the video
  - The quality of the code being presented 
    - Since people would probably copy and paste the code while watching, the code quality should be checked
    - Should avoid less secure and performant source code, unless stated during the walkthrough
  
#### Submission Procedure
  - Create a [work issue](https://github.com/tyvdh/stellar-quest-bounties/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=begin-the-hunt.yml&link=https://github.com/tyvdh/stellar-quest-bounties/blob/main/bounties/level-2/video-tutorials.md) for this bounty.
  - Upload the ready-for-review video on Google Drive and share the link inside the work issue
    - *Note:* If you plan to broadcast to your audience, please wait until a final version is reviewed
  - Upload the final video publicly on Youtube, Vimeo or any other popular video sites and update the link in the work issue
